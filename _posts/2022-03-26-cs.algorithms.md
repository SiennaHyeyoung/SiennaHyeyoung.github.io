## Algorithms

**Algorithm** means **processing** that converts data received from input into output.

When evaluating an algorithm, **accuracy** is important, but so is **efficiency**.

## Pseudo code

Pseudocode helps the computer procedurally figure out what needs to be done by setting the necessary actions or conditions well.

- functions (함수)
- condition (조건)
- Boolean: True or False
- Loop : cycle of doing something over and over again
